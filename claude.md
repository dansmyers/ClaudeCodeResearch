# Research Prompt: Recording Artist Productivity Over Time

## Research Question

Investigate whether successful recording artists have become less productive over time by analyzing how the pace of hit album releases has changed across decades.

## Data Sources

Use Billboard chart data from three charts, analyzed separately:

- Billboard 200
- Hot Country Albums
- Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums

## Artist Selection Criteria

For each chart, identify artists who:

- Have at least 3 albums that reached the top 40 on that chart
- Released their first top-40 album on that chart in 2022 or earlier
- Count only original studio albums and live albums; exclude compilations, reissues, and deluxe editions

Artists may appear in multiple chart analyses if they qualify independently on each chart. Analyze their discography on each chart separately.

## Productivity Measures

For each qualifying artist, calculate:

1. **Average gap between hits**: (date of last hit − date of first hit) / (number of hit albums − 1)
2. **Hit albums in first 10 years**: Count of top-40 albums released within 10 years of the artist's first hit on that chart

## Grouping

Assign each artist to a decade cohort based on the release year of their first top-40 album on that chart (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, 2020s).

## Deliverables

1. A summary of the methodology and data sources used
2. For each of the three charts, visualizations showing both productivity measures across decade cohorts
3. Analysis of trends and notable findings
4. Discussion of limitations and caveats

Aim for the largest feasible sample size using available Billboard data.
