# Research Agent Prompt: Housing Affordability and Young Male Wages Across U.S. Metro Areas

## Research Objective

Produce a PDF report analyzing how housing affordability relative to median wages for young men (ages 25-34) varies across the approximately 50 largest U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). The analysis should assess whether regional variation in affordability represents an empirically observable barrier to household formation for this demographic.

## Conceptual Framework

The analysis proceeds from the premise that perceived ability to support a household on a single income remains a significant factor in men's readiness for marriage and family formation, even in contexts where dual-income households are the norm. The report should engage briefly with relevant theoretical literature, including:

- Economic theories of marriage and household formation (e.g., Becker's specialization model and its critiques)
- Second demographic transition theory as it relates to delayed family formation
- Recent empirical work on economic preconditions for marriage among young adults

Theoretical engagement should contextualize the empirical analysis, not dominate it.

## Data Requirements

### Housing Costs

Use the most recent available data, preferably 2023-2024:

- 25th percentile sale price for single-family detached homes by MSA
- 50th percentile (median) sale price for single-family detached homes by MSA
- Median rent for 2-bedroom units by MSA

Preferred sources: U.S. Census Bureau, Zillow Research, Redfin, HUD Fair Market Rents.

### Wages

Use the most recent available data, preferably 2022-2023 ACS or CPS:

- Median annual earnings for men aged 25-34, stratified by educational attainment:
  - High school diploma or equivalent (no college)
  - Some college or associate degree
  - Bachelor's degree or higher
- Data should be for full-time, year-round workers where possible

Preferred sources: American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata, Current Population Survey (CPS), Bureau of Labor Statistics.

### Longitudinal Data (Secondary Analysis)

If reliable comparable data exist for earlier periods (e.g., 2010, 2000, 1990), include a secondary analysis of how the wage-to-housing ratio has changed over time at the national or regional level.

## Analytical Approach

### Primary Affordability Metric

A home is considered affordable if its price is ≤3× annual income.

### Calculations

For each MSA, calculate:

1. The ratio of 25th percentile home price to median earnings (by education level)
2. The ratio of 50th percentile home price to median earnings (by education level)
3. Rent burden: median 2BR rent as a percentage of monthly earnings (by education level)

### Presentation of Findings

Present findings to highlight:

- Which metros are affordable/unaffordable for each education tier
- Regional patterns (e.g., Sun Belt vs. coastal metros, Midwest vs. West)
- The education gradient in affordability (how much does a bachelor's degree improve affordability prospects?)

## Output Specifications

### Format

PDF report

### Style

Suitable for publication in an empirical social science journal (e.g., *Demography*, *Journal of Marriage and Family*, *Social Forces*). Use clear, precise academic prose. Avoid:

- Unnecessary jargon where plain language suffices
- Hedging phrases and filler common to AI-generated text (e.g., "it is important to note that," "in today's society")
- Bullet-point formatting in the body of the report
- Excessive repetition of findings

### Citation Style

APA 7th edition

### Sources

Prioritize peer-reviewed academic research for theoretical and contextual claims. Use official government statistics (Census, BLS, HUD) for empirical data. Data sources should be cited with retrieval dates.

### Length

Approximately 2,500 words, excluding references and tables. Expand if necessary to present findings clearly, but do not pad.

### Structure

1. Abstract (150-200 words)
2. Introduction (research question, significance, scope)
3. Background (brief theoretical context, prior empirical findings)
4. Data and Methods (sources, operationalization of variables, analytical approach)
5. Findings (organized by key patterns: regional variation, education gradient, rent vs. purchase)
6. Discussion (interpretation, limitations, implications for family formation research)
7. References
8. Tables/Figures (at minimum: summary table of affordability ratios by MSA and education level; consider a figure showing regional patterns)

## Scope Limitations

This analysis focuses specifically on young men's economic position relative to housing costs. It does not attempt to model:

- Women's earnings or dual-income household scenarios
- Non-housing costs of living
- Subjective attitudes toward marriage or family
- Actual marriage or fertility rates (though these may be referenced contextually)

The report should acknowledge these scope limitations explicitly.

## Quality Criteria

The final report should:

- Present a clear, answerable research question
- Use the most recent reliable data available
- Apply consistent methodology across metros
- Distinguish clearly between descriptive findings and interpretive claims
- Acknowledge uncertainty and data limitations
- Maintain a neutral, empirical tone—the goal is to assess whether regional affordability variation is an observable phenomenon, not to advocate for particular policy responses
